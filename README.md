# Nashville Software School Cohort 47 

Our cohort wanted to work on this website as a team. We were all determined to make an impact - so we formed smaller teams (wireframe, data organization, coding, design, content development, project management and QA), each with tasks to accomplish. Usually a website with 29 developers might be too many chefs in the kitchen, but with a lot of teamwork, some organization and the best cohort - this site came together quickly/seamlessly.
